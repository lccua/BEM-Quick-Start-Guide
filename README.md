# BEM Quick Start Guide

BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) is a methodology designed for developing web interfaces with reusable components. Here's a quick guide to understanding the core concepts of BEM.

## Block

### Explanation

- Blocks are independent, reusable components, such as menus or buttons.
- They are identified by the `class` attribute in HTML.
- The block name should describe its purpose, not its appearance.

### Naming Convention

- block-name

### Example

```html
<div class="error"></div>
```
